# MOVIE RECOMMENDER

Definition of Recommender Systems:

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous, and can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders.


There are basically two approaches to make recommendations:

->Collaborative filtering (or social filtering)

->Content-based filtering

 Content Based Movie Recommendation System:

It uses attributes such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make suggestions for the users. The intuition behind this sort of recommendation system is that if a user liked a particular movie or show, he/she might like a movie or a show similar to it.

## Following libraries were being used in the project:

1.Numpy: Used for working with arrays.

2.Pandas: Used for data analysis.

3.Sklearn: Used for making use of Machine learning tools.

4.AST: This module helps python application to process trees of the python abstract syntax grammar.

5.Pickle: Used for serializing and de-serializing python object structures.
